# Empire
Empire 4 is a post-exploitation framework that includes a pure-PowerShell Windows agents, Python 3.x Linux/OS X agents, 
and C# agents. It is the merger of the previous PowerShell Empire and Python EmPyre projects. The framework offers 
cryptologically-secure communications and flexible architecture.

On the PowerShell side, Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly 
deployable post-exploitation modules ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade 
network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework. PowerShell Empire premiered at 
[BSidesLV in 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq9t59w0mUI) and Python EmPyre premiered at HackMiami 2016. 
BC Security presented updates to further evade Microsoft Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) and JA3/S signatures at 
[DEF CON 27](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/DEFCON27).

Empire relies heavily on the work from several other projects for its underlying functionality. We have tried to call 
out a few of those people we've interacted with heavily [here](http://www.powershellempire.com/?page_id=2) and have 
included author/reference link information in the source of each Empire module as appropriate. If we have failed to 
properly cite existing or prior work, please let us know at Empire@BC-Security.org.

Empire is currently being developed and maintained by [@Cx01N](https://twitter.com/Cx01N_), 
[@Hubbl3](https://twitter.com/_Hubbl3), & [@Vinnybod](https://twitter.com/_vinnybod). While the original Empire project is
no longer maintained, this fork is maintained by [@bcsecurity1](https://twitter.com/BCSecurity1). Please reach out to 
us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/P8PZPyf) if you have any questions or want to talk about offensive security.

[Starkiller](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Starkiller) is a GUI for PowerShell Empire that interfaces remotely with Empire via its API. Starkiller can be ran as a replacement for the Empire client or in a mixed environment with Starkiller and Empire clients.

## Contribution Rules
Contributions are more than welcome! The more people who contribute to the project the better Empire will be for everyone. Below are a few guidelines for submitting contributions.

* Submit pull requests to the [dev branch](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/tree/dev). After testing, changes will be merged to master.
* Depending on what you're working on, base your module on [powershell_template.py](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/blob/master/empire/server/modules/powershell_template.py) or [python_template.py](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/blob/master/empire/server/modules/python_template.py). **Note** that for some modules you may need to massage the output to get it into a nicely displayable text format with [Out-String](https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/Empire/blob/0cbdb165a29e4a65ad8dddf03f6f0e36c33a7350/lib/modules/situational_awareness/network/powerview/get_user.py#L111).
* Cite previous work in the **'Comments'** module section.
* If your script.ps1 logic is large, may be reused by multiple modules, or is updated often, consider implementing the logic in the appropriate **data/module_source/*** directory and [pulling the script contents into the module on tasking](https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/Empire/blob/0cbdb165a29e4a65ad8dddf03f6f0e36c33a7350/lib/modules/situational_awareness/network/powerview/get_user.py#L85-L95).
* Use [approved PowerShell verbs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands?view=powershell-7.1) for any functions.
* TEST YOUR MODULE! Be sure to run it from an Empire agent and test Python 3.x functionality before submitting a pull to ensure everything is working correctly.
* For additional guidelines for your PowerShell code itself, check out the [PowerSploit style guide](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/README.md).
